# Francesc's Bio
Hey there, I'm Francesc, a Staff Android Engineer with 25 years of experience in Software Development and 14 on Android, with a proven track record of delivering world class apps.

I build Android mobile apps for a large variety of clients using modern technologies including Kotlin, Coroutines, Flows, Dependency Injection, Jetpack Compose, Architecture Components, Clean Architecture, MVI, and GraphQL.
